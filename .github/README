Theming utilities for your Neovim.
STATUS: WIP
NVIM: v0.8.0

WARN: This plugin is in an early stage and docs are a bit sparse.
Feel free to try it out though and let me know if you have
any problems/suggestions.

PACKER
------
Following is a very minimal configuration for colo.
Plenary is the only hard-dependency. You can opt-out
installing integration plugins if you decide not to use
colo integrations or, prefer your own configuration instead.
use({
  "dharmx/nvim-colo",
  requires = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "akinsho/bufferline.nvim",
    "feline-nvim/feline.nvim",
    {
      "lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim", ---required by feline
      config = function()
        require("gitsigns").setup()
      end
    },
    "kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons",
  },
  config = function()
    ---integrations are enabled by default
    require("colo").setup()
  end
})

CONFIG
______
Configuration is done by passing a table to the setup function.
The following are the default settings.
local config = {
  theme = "radium", ---only colo-compatible themes allowed
  variant = "dark",
  plug_manually = false,
  integrations = {
    feline = {
      enable = true,
      module = "colo.integrations.feline"
    },
    bufferline = {
      enable = true,
      module = "colo.integrations.bufferline"
    },
    devicons = {
      enable = true,
      module = "colo.integrations.devicons"
    },
  },
}
NOTE: Integration plugin's caches are needed to be cleared.
      That is why a integrations.<integration>.module
      option is given. If you want to use your own configuration
      instead then pass your module path there.
NOTE: Integrations are loaded using a loop. You can take advantage
      of this. If you want to integrate another plugin then do the following.
      ...
      config.integrations.example = {
        enable = true,
        module = "my_config.example"
      }
      colo.setup(config)

COMMANDS
--------
:Colo <theme_name>

PERFORMANCE
-----------
There are quite a few ways to inprove performance.
1. After you have finished making your colorscheme, generate the
   Color method calls into hex strings. Although it would be annoying
   if you decide to modify the colorscheme.
2. Turn off all integrations and manually call the following. And also
   define an autocmd that will call it on the ColorScheme event.
3. You may have noticed the plug_manually configuration option. This
   is added if the user wanted to use colo integration configurations
   but they need to lazy-load them. In this case, you may
   set that option to true, which will skip loading the integrations
   when colo is loaded in. But, will reload when a colorscheme is changed.
   Following is an example of how you'd lazy-load feline.nvim.
   use({
     "dharmx/nvim-colo",
     event = "UIEnter"
     config = function()
       require("colo").setup({
         plug_manually = true,
         integrations = {
           feline = { enable = true },
           bufferline = { enable = false },
           devicons = { enable = false },
         },
      })
     end
   })

   use({
     "feline-nvim/feline.nvim",
     event = "InsertEnter",
     config = function()
       require("colo.integrations.feline")
     end
   })

I need help defining the highlights for different themes.
So, if you can or, have the time then please do so. Make a pull request.
